Quantum Game with Photons - https://github.com/stared/quantum-game

A puzzle game with photons, quantum superposition and entanglement that includes single qubit concepts.

QPong - https://github.com/HuangJunye/QPong

A quantum version of Pong where gameplay is affected by quantum operations on qubits.

Quantum Tetris - https://github.com/QCHackers/QuantumTetris

A Tetris variant where game mechanics are influenced by quantum operations.

Quantum Chess - https://github.com/caphindsight/TrulyQuantumChess
A chess variant with quantum mechanics, including single-qubit operations.
Quantum Mechanics Visualization - https://github.com/stared/quantum-mechanics-visualization
Educational visualizations of quantum concepts including Bloch sphere for single qubits.
Quirk - https://github.com/Strilanc/Quirk
Not strictly a game, but an interactive quantum circuit simulator with excellent visualizations for understanding 1-qubit operations.

These repositories offer different approaches to understanding quantum concepts through games, with special focus on single-qubit operations. Some are more educational, while others are more game-oriented.
